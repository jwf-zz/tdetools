Time-Delay Embedding Classification Apps
========================================

License: MIT

This project contains proof-of-concept tools for time-series classification using time-delay embeddings (See Frank et al., 2010). 

System Dependencies
===================

1. `sudo apt-get install cmake libopencv-dev libann-dev libboost-dev`

This project depends on the nonlinear time series analysis toolbox [Tisean
3.0.1](http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean/Tisean_3.0.1/)

For convenience, we extracted the necessary C library under the `external/`
folder and should be built automatically.

Compiling
=========

Under the `tdetools/` directory:

1. `cmake .`
2. `make`

Or to to keep the build under a separate directory:

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cmake ../`
3. `make`

Usage
=====

To build a model from a time series represented in CSV format, use the `buildtree` command:

    Usage: ./buildtree [options] [datafile]
    Options:
    Everything not being a valid option will be interpreted as a possible datafile.
    If no datafile is given stdin is read. Just - also means stdin
        -l # of data [default: whole file]
        -x # of rows to ignore [default: 0]
        -M num. of columns to read [default: 1]
        -c columns to read [default: 1]
        -m dimension [default: 2]
        -p # dimension to reduce to using PCA [default: same as m, ie. no reduction]
        -d delay [default: 1]
        -V verbosity level [default: 1]
                0='only panic messages'
                1='+ input/output messages'
        -o output file [default: datafile.dmp]
        -h show these options


To classify a data set, put the filenames of the models, one per line, in a file called `models.ini` and run the `classifytrajectory` command:

    Usage: ./classifytrajectory [options]
    Options:
    Everything not being a valid option will be interpreted as a possible datafile.
    If no datafile is given stdin is read. Just - also means stdin
        -l # of data [default: whole file]
        -x # of rows to ignore [default: 0]
        -M num. of columns to read [default: 1]
        -c columns to read [default: 1]
        -n number of neighbours to match [default: 4]
        -s length of matched segments [default: 32]
        -A # of algorithm to use (1: old, 2: new (unpublished), 3: fancy new(buggy)) [default: old algorithm (1)]
        -V verbosity level [default: 0]
                0='only panic messages'
                1='+ input/output messages'
        -h show these options

The `classifytrajectory` command will send the similarity scores to `STDOUT`, where the order of the scores corresponds to the order of the models
in the `models.ini` file.

Included is a script, `run-walks-test.sh`, which gives a simple example of how to use these two applications. It takes three parameters, the embedding
dimension, the noise-reduced dimension, and the delay, then uses these parameters to build four models for data from four different people walking.
Finally, it classifies a test data file, storing the scores in `tmp/walks-out.dat`. Running this with values `M=5, P=5, D=2`, for example, and plotting
the values for each column of the output file, you should see that the each of the subjects is recognized, in turn.

This is proof-of-concept code, but was implemented with efficiency in mind, and has been used to classify large data sets.
